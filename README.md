- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### What I learned



To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
<article>Some HTML code I'm proud of</article>
<main>Some HTML code I'm proud of</main>
<footer>Some HTML code I'm proud of</footer>
<time>Some HTML code I'm proud of</time>
<p>Some HTML code I'm proud of</p>
<span>Some HTML code I'm proud of</span>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
  display: flex;
  font-family: 'Plus Jakarta Sans';
:root{
     /* primary */
     --red: hsl(1, 90%, 64%);
     --blue: hsl(219, 85%, 26%);
     
     /*Neutral*/
     --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
     --Very-light-grayish-blue: hsl(210, 60%, 98%);
     --light-grayish-blue-1: hsl(211, 68%, 94%);
     --light-grayish-blue-2: hsl(205, 33%, 90%);
     --grayish-blue: hsl(219, 14%, 63%);
     --dark-grayish-blue: hsl(219, 12%, 42%);
     --very-dark-blue: hsl(224, 21%, 14%);
     --box-shadow: 8px 8px 60px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06);
}
}
